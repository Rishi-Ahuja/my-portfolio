## About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m **Rishi Ahuja**, a 1B Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo.

During my time at the University of Waterloo, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of being selected as one of the two **Undergraduate Representatives** for the **David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science Council**. This role has given me **voting rights on critical school matters**, allowing me to actively contribute to decisions that shape the academic experience. 

Beyond programming, I enjoy immersing myself in cricket, relaxing with sitcoms, and taking long walks that allow me to reflect and recharge.

## Programming Experience

My journey into programming began during Grade 8, when I experimented with Scratch and MIT App Inventor. Soon after, I delved into programming Arduino, a hobby I still find exciting and rewarding.

As I progressed, I've gained experience in a variety of technologies and languages. From building modern web applications with JavaScript frameworks to exploring machine learning models and statistical analysis, Iâ€™ve developed a versatile skill set. My academic projects have also allowed me to explore programming in **Java**, **C**, **C++**, **Racket**, and, of course, **Python**â€”my favorite language for its elegance and simplicity.
